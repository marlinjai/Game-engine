# Game-engine
This is my first Game Engine built in LWJGL and GLSL

I developed the files in src/project as for my current major in international Media and computing. 

The current version uses a simple GLSL pipeline to render 3d Objects to the screen using Matrix Calculations.

A propper explanation about how the code works is gonna follow soon.
